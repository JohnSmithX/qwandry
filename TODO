TODO, or perhaps not...

- Differentiate multiple similar matches (show path or repository label)
- Allow better customization of repositories
  - Customize collection phase (see LibraryRepository)
  - Customize naming phase
- If the user is using rvm, add the ruby src directory to the search path, maybe merge it with the normal ruby
  - Examples: opening digest could get you both the ruby and the C sources.
- For editors that don't support multi opening collections of files (ie: ./digest.rb and ./digest/) we could trick them by adding symlinks in a temp dir.
  - Could be an option... might be a terrible idea :)
- Instead of requiring users to find and configure other languages, small scripts for perl, python, etc. could introspect on their load paths.
