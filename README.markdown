Qwandry, a questionable tool
=============================

Why spend time trying to remember where libraries, projects, and packages are 
lurking when your computer can do it faster?

		qw activerecord # opens the activerecord gem in your editor
		qw matrix	      # opens ruby's matrix class in your editor
		
Installation
------------
Qwandry is a standard ruby gem, on any system with ruby installed already 
simply install with:

    gem install qwandry

Usage
-----
Just type `qw` and the first few letters of what you're looking for.  By 
default Qwandry is set up for locating and editing ruby libraries.

    qw date # opens ruby's date library

Want to use Qwandry with Python, Perl, or other languages?

    qw --customize
